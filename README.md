# DIY Synthesizer ðŸŽµðŸŽ¹

A simple NodeJS synthesizer for Raspberry PI

## Raspberry PI Prerequisities

- Make sure audio output is set to the audio jack, not HDMI (unless your screen has speakers)
- Install ALSA header files: `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev`

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/bberak/diy-synthesizer.git
cd diy-synthesizer
npm install
npm run start
```

## Making Sure The Synthesizer Is Always Running

Copy the example service file to the `systemd` folder:

```
sudo cp src/diy-synthesizer.service /etc/systemd/system/diy-synthesizer.service
```

> Make sure you change the contents of this file to reference paths in your environment.

Enable and start the servie:

```
systemctl enable diy-synthesizer # follow the prompts
systemctl start diy-synthesizer  # follow the prompts
```

Finally, reboot to see it in action and test that it works.

### Create a Cronjob 

If you want to automatically start the synthesizer after a reboot (or error), you can add a cron job.

Run `sudo crontab -e`

Then add the following line to check if the process is running every 5 seconds

```
```
