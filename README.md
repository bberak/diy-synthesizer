# DIY Synthesizer ðŸŽµðŸŽ¹

A simple NodeJS synthesizer for Raspberry PI

## Raspberry PI Prerequisities

- Make sure audio output is set to the audio jack, not HDMI (unless your screen has speakers)
- Install ALSA header files: `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev`

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/bberak/diy-synthesizer.git
cd diy-synthesizer
npm install
npm run start
```

## Making Sure The Synthesizer Is Always Running

Create a service file under `/etc/systemd/system` with the following contents:

```
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=~/Dev/diy-synthesizer
ExecStart=/home/pi/.nvm/versions/node/v8.16.2/bin/npm run start
Restart=always
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=diy-synthesizer
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Make sure you change the paths and user to suit your environment. An example service file has been saved in the `src` folder.

Finally, reboot to see it in action.

### Create a Cronjob 

If you want to automatically start the synthesizer after a reboot (or error), you can add a cron job.

Run `sudo crontab -e`

Then add the following line to check if the process is running every 5 seconds

```
```
